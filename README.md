# Decentralized IP Management System (DIPMS)
### Main Technologies
- Story Protocol APIs for Mint, Lease, Set IP Rules
- Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) for MetaData Semantic Graph Visualization
- Trifecta Data Layer for Post-Quantum IPFS Storage
> The goal is to bring programmability and composability to intellectual property, unleashing a new era of creativity where IPs can transcend mediums, platforms, and be dynamically remixed and monetized based on creator-defined rules. 
> This aims to solve issues around IP protection and monetization in the age of generative AI and global distribution.
## Representing Programmable IPs as Knowledge Assets on the DKG
- Attaching verifiable metadata, provenance, and rights information to programmable IPs using the DKG's RDF data model.
- Integrating programmable IPs with other data sources and knowledge graphs on the decentralized web.
> Programmable IP License (PIL) allows creators to specify rights and rules for their IP in a machine-readable format.

### DKG provides the foundational data infrastructure to represent programmable IPs as interconnected Knowledge Assets, complete with verifiable metadata, provenance, and rights information. This enables the seamless querying, discovery, and integration of programmable IPs across various applications and ecosystems.
